## Introduction

The purpose of this repo is to create a Reddit Client with TypeScript. I'm on a TypeScript learning journey so I reckon this is a great way to learn.

If you are also interested in learning TypeScript feel free to contribute.

Read the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started. Then pick an endpoint from the Reddit API docs and create a pull request.

Just be sure to add unit and e2e tests üôèüèº

## Goals

- [ ] Include most the official Reddit api endpoints
- [ ] Promise-based
- [ ] Fully typed. Both for query parameters and responses.

## Work in Progress

Endpoints Completed so far:

Mostly the 'listing section' https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/#section_listings

/api/v1/access_token

/new/
/r/_subreddit_/new/
/hot/
/r/_subreddit_/hot/
/rising/
/r/_subreddit_/rising/
/hot/
/r/_subreddit_/hot/
/r/best/
/r/_subreddit_/best/

Where _subreddit_ is the name of the subredit

## Install

        npm i reddit-client-api

## Usage

```
    import RedditClient from "reddit-client-api";

    const config = {
      apiKey: `${process.env.REDDIT_APIKEY}`,
      apiSecret: `${process.env.REDDIT_APISECRET}`,
      userAgent: `${process.env.USERAGENT}`,
    };
    const myRedditClient = new RedditClient(config);
    await myRedditClient.auth({ username: `${process.env.USERNAME}`, password: `${process.env.PASSWORD}` });

    // get Rising Posts limited to 2 posts per page and 2 pages
    const risingPosts = await myRedditClient.getRisingPosts(2, 2);
    const risingSideprojectPosts = await myRedditClient.getRisingPostsBySubreddit('sideproject', 2, 2);
